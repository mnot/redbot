Header- and Status-specific detail/definition messages

Each should be in the form:

  HDR_HEADER_NAME = {'lang': u'message'}
or
  STATUS_NNN = {'lang': u'message'}

where HEADER_NAME is the header's field name in all capitals and with hyphens
replace with underscores, NNN is the three-digit status code, lang' is a
language tag, and 'message' is a description of the header that may
contain HTML.

The following %(var)s style variable interpolations are available:
  field_name - the name of the header

PLEASE NOTE: the description IS NOT ESCAPED, and therefore all variables to be
interpolated into it need to be escaped.
