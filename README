* REQUIREMENTS

RED needs:
  1) Python 2.5 or greater; see <http://python.org/>
  2) a Web server that implements the CGI interface; e.g., Apache 
     <http://httpd.apache.org/>.
  3) The nbhttp library; see <http://github.com/mnot/nbhttp/>
  4) Optionally, RED will take advantage of the pyevent extension, if installed.
     See <http://code.google.com/p/pyevent/>.

* INSTALLING RED

Unpack the RED tarball. There are a number of interesting files;

  - src/webui.py - the Web frontend for RED. This is what is run by the server.
  - src/*.py - other Python files necessary for RED.
  - src/red_style.css - RED's CSS stylesheet.
  - src/jquery.js - the JQuery <http://jquery.com/> JavaScript library.

Place webui.py where you wish it to be served from the Web server. For example,
with Apache you can put it in a directory and add these configuration directives
(e.g., in .htaccess, if enabled):

  AddHandler cgi-script .py
  DirectoryIndex webui.py
  
If the directory is the root htdocs directory for your server "example.com", 
this will configure RED to be at the URI "http://example.com/".

red_style.css and jquery.js must be available at the same URI path as RED; 
in the deployment above, the easiest thing to do is to place them in the same
directory.

Finally, the other .py files must be available to Python; you can either place
them in the same directory, or somewhere else on your PYTHONPATH. See Python's
documentation for more information.

* SUPPORT, REPORTING ISSUES AND CONTRIBUTING

See <http://redbot.org/project> to give feedback, report issues, and contribute
to the project. You can also join the redbot-users mailing list there.
